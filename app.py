        **Interpretation:**
        The model has identified features within the tissue sample that are highly indicative of malignant cells. This classification is based on patterns learned from thousands of labeled histopathological images.
        
        **Key indicators may include:**
        - Irregular cell nuclei shape and size.
        - High density of cells (hypercellularity).
        - Presence of mitotic figures suggesting rapid cell division.
        
        **Next Steps:**
        This result warrants immediate review by a qualified pathologist for definitive diagnosis and to determine the cancer's type and grade.

        The model's analysis suggests that the provided tissue sample does not contain malignant cells. The cellular structures appear normal and consistent with healthy tissue.

        **Key indicators observed:**
        - Uniform cell shapes and sizes.
        - Normal tissue architecture.
        - Absence of invasive patterns.

        **Next Steps:**
        While this result is positive, it should be confirmed as part of a comprehensive medical evaluation by a healthcare professional.
